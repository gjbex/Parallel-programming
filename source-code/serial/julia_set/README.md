# Julia set

Straightforward implementation of the Julia set computation.


## What is it?

1. `julia_set.cpp`: C++ application that computes the Julia set.
1. `array2d.h`: implementation of a 2D array data structure.
1. `julia_set.f90`: Fortran application that computes the Julia set.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
1. `plot_julia_set.py`: Python script to plot the data generated
   by the C++ application.
