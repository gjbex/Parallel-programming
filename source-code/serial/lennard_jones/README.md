# Lennard-Jones

This is a starting point for a code that simulates particles that interact
via a Lennard-Jones potential.  There is lots of potential for optimization
and parallelization.


## What is it?

1. `lennard_jones.cpp`: C++ application that simulates a system of interacting
   particles.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
