# MultiLevel

OpenMP supports nested parallel regions.  This may be useful when
using libraries such as MKL that are multi-threaded.

## What is it?

1. `Simple`: illustrates a very simple case of nested parallel
   regions.
1. `LinearAlgebra`: illustrates how to use nested parallelism when
   both the top-level application and a library are multi-threaded.
